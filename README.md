# NOVA.one-ROBOT
This repo contains all the files and necessary software need to replicate the nova one project.
NOVA (Nimble Oriented Vehicle for automation);
We are embarking on an exciting project aimed at helping you learn some interesting 
concepts such as , 3D modeling within a CAD software like (FUSSION360), Electronics and sensors, Node.js and Matlab.

The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic, versatile, visually appealing and user-friendly robot that incorporates cutting-edge tech at fraction of the cost.

This project is brocken down into 2 groups. the 3D models for the frame and the software that is used to run all the components of the robot.![project-2](https://github.com/GEMINI64K/NOVA.one-ROBOT/assets/117120767/0946aa67-511c-4bc4-9abd-2d09552cb8c7)
